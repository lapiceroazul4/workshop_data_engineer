## Project Usability and Potential Applications

Welcome to the workshop_data_engineer project! This README focuses on illustrating the project's potential applications and how it can be useful.

### Understanding Project Scope

The main objective of this project is to showcase a practical implementation of Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes using Python and SQLAlchemy. The project revolves around a dataset containing candidate information from a Technology company. Through various operations, we extract insights, transform data, and load it into a database for analysis.

### Potential Usages

1. **Data Analysis and Visualization:** The project includes various data analysis and visualization tasks. You can leverage this structure to analyze hiring trends, identify popular technologies, and evaluate seniority distributions. The generated visualizations provide an intuitive way to communicate your findings.

2. **Recruitment Insights:** By examining the trends in candidate hiring, you can gain valuable insights into recruitment practices. The comparison of hiring patterns across different years and countries helps in understanding recruitment strategies' effectiveness.

3. **Decision-Making Support:** The visualized data and analytical insights can aid decision-making processes. For instance, understanding which technologies are most sought after by the company or identifying potential gaps in recruitment efforts can guide resource allocation.

4. **Database Integration Practice:** The project demonstrates database integration through SQLAlchemy. This provides a hands-on experience for those looking to enhance their database skills and understand how data flows between Python and a database system.

5. **Customization for Specific Data:** While the current project utilizes a specific dataset, the provided code can serve as a foundation for similar data-related tasks. By modifying the transformations, queries, and visualizations, you can adapt the project to analyze different datasets.

### How to Use

To explore the potential applications of this project, follow these steps:

1. Review the code in [Database.py], [Transformation.py], and [Main.py] to understand the structure and functionality.
2. Identify sections relevant to your analysis goals and customize them to suit your dataset and objectives.
3. Utilize the provided visualization functions and adjust the charts to visualize data insights effectively.
4. Run [Main.py] to execute the customized functions and generate query results and visualizations based on your data.

Keep in mind that this project provides a template for ETL processes and data analysis. You can build upon it to explore and address specific challenges in data processing and analysis.
